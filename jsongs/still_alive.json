Haha. FAT CHANCE.\r\nAnyway, this cake is great.\r\nIt's so delicious and moist.\r\n\r\nLook at me still talking when there's science to do.\r\nWhen I look out there it makes me GLaD I'm not you.\r\nI've experiments to run there is research to be done\r\nOn the people who are still alive\r\n\r\nAnd believe me I am still alive.\r\nI'm doing science and I'm still alive.\r\nI feel FANTASTIC and I'm still alive.\r\nWhile you're dying I'll be still alive.\r\nAnd when you're dead I will be still alive.\r\n\r\nStill alive\r\nStill alive\r\n",
